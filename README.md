## Assignments

### ðŸ“Œ Assignment 1: Nginx Setup with Multipass and Ansible
- Created a new **virtual machine** using **Multipass**.
- Configured an **Ansible playbook** to install and configure **Nginx**.
- Restricted access to specific **IP addresses** using **Jinja2 templates**.

### ðŸ“Œ Assignment 2: Nginx Setup with Ansible Roles
- Implemented the same **Nginx setup** but structured it using **Ansible roles**.
- Created a reusable **Ansible role** for automated Nginx configuration.
- Improved maintainability and **scalability** of the deployment.
- [ðŸ“„ Read More](./assignment02/README.md)

## Requirements
- **Multipass** installed and configured.
- **Ansible** installed and configured.
- **SSH access** to target machines.
- Proper **privilege escalation** (`become: true`) for Ansible tasks.

## Running the Playbooks
To execute the **Ansible playbooks**, navigate to the respective assignment folder and run:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```

## Conclusion
This repository showcases two approaches to deploying **Nginx with Ansible**. The **first assignment** focuses on using a straightforward playbook, while the **second assignment** demonstrates the power of **Ansible roles** for better organization and reusability.
